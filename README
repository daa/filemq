This python module provides file-based message queue.

example of use:

import filemq
# new message queue in /var/spool/filemq
mq = filemq.FileMQ('/var/spool/filemq')
# put message to queue
mq.put('hello')
# get message
m = mq.get()
# now work with it
# ...
# commit if message successfully worked
mq.commit(m)
# or you may put message back to queue:
# mq.rollback(m)
# or remove from queue signalling that message processing
# was unsuccessful
# mq.discard(m)
